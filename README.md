# Twinkle
**Twinkle** is an easy-to-use C++ networking library that I built some time back for an in-house Game Engine. Code examples can be found inside the [Samples](https://github.com/touqir14/twinkle/tree/main/Samples) directory. Currently, it only supports MSVC compiler and requires C++17 compatibility.
